# WebWithJS

I tried to create a single index with only JavaScript in background. I minimized the index.html only with 12 lines of code.
Also to avoid duplicates I will include npm modules next update.

The Repo will be divided into two main parts:
1. BOM will include the CSS links and default title/meta elements.
2. DOM will include the main part.

The constructor that is defined inside every class does have the same style in every file.
First the elements are being defined created and edited. Then they are seperated with the part that they will be rendered into their parent element.
